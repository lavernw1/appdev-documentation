.Next Steps: Update your booster using Continuous Delivery
Your booster is automatically configured to build and deploy with new commits.

. Clone your project from GitHub.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone {GITHUB_CREATE}
----

. Open your project in your desired IDE or editor.
. Perform any updates you want to the project.
. Commit and push your changes back to GitHub.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Made an update"
$ git push
----

IMPORTANT: When changes are pushed to your GitHub repository, a new build is automatically triggered on your OpenShift project with those changes.

More details on interacting with your booster can be found in your booster's link:{GITHUB_CREATE}/blob/master/README.adoc[README.adoc^].

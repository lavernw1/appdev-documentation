= Deploying the Relational Database Backend Booster Application and Obtaining the Application URL

You can build and deploy the {VertX} Relational Database Backend booster application to OpenShift from source using a Jenkins Conitnuous Integration server instance running in your OpenShift project.

. To define the build pipeline for the Relational Database Backend application, deploy the Jenkins CI server instance to your project by executing the following command:
+
[source,bash,option="nowrap"]
--
oc new-app -f src/openshift/openshift-pipeline-template.yml
--
+
. To start the build, execute the following command:
+
[source,bash,option="nowrap"]
--
oc start-build vertx-crud
--
+
. When your application is fully deployed, execute the following command to obtain its path:
+
[source,bash,option="nowrap"]
--
oc get route {app-name} -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}
--
+
This returns the application URL that you can use to access the web interface or interact with the application endpoints:

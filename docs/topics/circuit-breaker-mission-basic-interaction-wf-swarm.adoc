= Interacting with the Unmodified {WildFlySwarm} Booster

Once you have the {WildFlySwarm} booster deployed, you have the following services running:

`{app-name}-name`::
Exposes the following endpoints:

* the `/api/name` endpoint, which returns a name when this service is working, and an error when this service is set up to demonstrate failure.

* the `/api/state` endpoint, which controls the behavior of the `/api/name` endpoint and determines whether the service works correctly or demonstrates failure.

`{app-name}-greeting`::
Exposes the following endpoints:

* the `/api/greeting` endpoint that you can call to get a personalized greeting response.
+
When you call the `/api/greeting` endpoint, it issues a call against the `/api/name` endpoint of the `{app-name}-name` service as part of processing your request.
The call made against the `/api/name` endpoint is protected by the Circuit Breaker.
+
If the remote endpoint is available, it responds with an HTTP code `200` and you receive the following greeting:
+
----
{"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
+
If the remote endpoint is unavailable, it responds with an HTTP code `500` and you receive a predefined fallback response:
+
----
{"content":"Hello, Fallback!"}
----

* the `/api/cb-state` endpoint, which returns the state of the Circuit Breaker. The state can be _open_ or _closed_.

The following steps demonstrate how to verify the service availability, simulate a failure and receive a fallback response.


NOTE: The following steps use the command line to interact with the service. Alternatively, you can use the web interface to perform the same steps.

//TODO: add a warning not to use `http` as it may contain cached responses from the remote endpoint.
. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the `{app-name}-greeting` service. You can also use the `Invoke` button in the web interface to do this.
// include image of the invoke button?
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
----
$ curl http://{app-name}-greeting-{project-name}.{osl-route-hostname}/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
+
// Add note about the Toggle button not working
// no scaler implemented error if CLI used to scale down pod
+
. To simulate the failure of the `{app-name}-name` service you can:
+
* use the `Toggle` button in the web interface.
* scale the number of replicas of the pod running the `{app-name}-name` service down to 0.
* execute an HTTP `PUT` request against the `/api/state` endpoint of the `{app-name}-name` service to set its state to `fail`.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
----
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "fail"}' http://{app-name}-name-{project-name}.{osl-route-hostname}/api/state
----
+
. The Circuit Breaker state indicator in the web interface changes from `CLOSED` to `OPEN` and the Circuit Breaker issues the fallback response when you invoke the `/api/greeting` endpoint.
+
[source,bash,option="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://{app-name}-greeting-{project-name}.{osl-route-hostname}/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, Fallback!"}
----
+
. Restore the name `{app-name}-name` service to availability.
To do this you can:
+
* use the `Toggle` button in the web interface.
* scale the number of replicas of the pod running the `{app-name}-name` service back up to 1.
* execute an HTTP `PUT` request against the `/api/state` endpoint of the `{app-name}-name` service to set its state back to `ok`.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
----
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"state": "ok"}' http://{app-name}-name-{project-name}.{osl-route-hostname}/api/state
----
+
. Invoke the `/api/greeting` endpoint again.
If the `{app-name}-name` service is available, you should receive the `Hello World!` greeting as the response:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
----
$ curl http://{app-name}-greeting-{project-name}.{osl-route-hostname}/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}

= Running Integration Tests

This booster contains a set of integration tests.
To run them, you must be connected to an OpenShift instance and select the project that will be used for testing.

To run the integration tests, execute the following command:

[source,bash,option="nowrap"]
--
$ mvn clean verify -Popenshift,openshift-it
--

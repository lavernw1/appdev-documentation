= Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

IMPORTANT: You must have a link:http://github.com[GitHub] account to set up a personal access token. If you do not have one, you must link:http://github.com/join[create a GitHub account] before continuing.

The {launcher} application adds generated starter applications called _boosters_ to your GitHub namespace. This requires the {launcher} application to have access to your GitHub account, which is granted using a GitHub personal access token.

To create a GitHub personal access token:

. Using a web browser, navigate to `https://github.com/settings/tokens`.
. Select _Generate new token_.
. Add a token description, for example `{launcher} on Minishift`.
. Select the following parent scopes and all their children:
** `repo`
** `admin:repo_hook`
. Click  _Generate token_.
. Save the hex code of the personal access token. You need this to complete the installation of the {launcher} application on your {OpenShiftLocal}.
+
IMPORTANT: This hex code only appears once and cannot be recreated. If you lose this hex code you will need to create a new personal access token.

= Using the {launcher} Application to Launch a Booster

After you have the {launcher} application running on your {OpenShiftLocal}, you can use it to create a new project, your booster.

To create a booster:

. Navigate to the {launcher} application using your browser.
. Select _Prepare for Takeoff_.
. At the bottom of the launch option explanations, choose a launch option, for example `Continuous Delivery`, and click _Next_.
+
NOTE: `Continuous Delivery` will build and deploy your booster directly from your GitHub repository while `Zip` requires you to manually build and deploy your application.

. Choose the mission, for example `{name-mission-http-api}` and click _Next_.
. Choose the runtime you would like to run, for example `{VertX}`.
+
NOTE: Each mission illustrates a concept and is implemented as a booster in at least one runtime. You can come back to the {launcher} application later and try another mission and runtime.

. You may update any of the pre-filled details or leave them with the default details. Click _Next_.

Your booster is now prepared for launch. Depending on your launch option, follow the steps in xref:launcher-launch-booster-cd[] or xref:launcher-launch-booster-manual[] for takeoff.

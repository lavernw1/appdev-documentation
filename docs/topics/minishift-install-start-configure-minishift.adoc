= Starting and Configuring the {OpenShiftLocal} for the {launcher} Application

NOTE: Starting your {OpenShiftLocal} may trigger a download of large virtual machines or Linux container images. This may take a while. Subsequent startups should be shorter as long as the virtual machines and Linux container images remained cached.

. Start your {OpenShiftLocal}.

Starting local OpenShift cluster using 'kvm' hypervisor...
...
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.42.152:8443

You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: <any value>

To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin

[NOTE]
====
Your {OpenShiftLocal}, by default, will select a virtual machine driver. Depending upon your system setup, you may need manually specify an alternative virtual machine driver using the `--vm-driver` flag, for example `--vm-driver=virtualbox` would use VirtualBox. Virtual machine software, such as link:https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox 5.x], is installed separately. On macOS, the `xhyve` driver may be unreliable and the `VirtualBox` is a reliable alternative. If your system works without specifying the virtual machine driver, we recommend you use the default configuration.

Depending on your operating system, virtual machine driver, and the number of boosters you run, you may need to increase the amount memory you give you to your {OpenShiftLocal}.

+
You now have OpenShift running in a single-node cluster on your local machine. The log information provided by your {OpenShiftLocal} provides the address you need to use to access the web console as well as the credentials to log in. In the above example, the console is located at `+++https://192.168.42.152:8443+++`, the username is `developer` and the password is `developer`.

. Open the web console using a web browser and authenticate.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since a {OpenShiftLocal} is for development purposes, it uses HTTPS for the web console and only provides a self-signed certificate. You may need to allow your browser to bypass SSL security policies as it tries to protect you from using `HTTPS` without a certificate signed by a certificate authority. The below screenshot shows the warning message in the Chrome browser.

At this time, Safari on macOS does not work with a {OpenShiftLocal}. This a link:https://github.com/openshiftio/appdev-planning/issues/16[known issue]. Other browsers, such as Chrome, on macOS do work with a {OpenShiftLocal}.

. Delete the preconfigured project.
+
The default installation provides a single pre-configured project, which you can delete. Click the three-dot menu icon next to the project name, select _Delete Project_ from the drop-down menu, and complete the confirmation to delete it.

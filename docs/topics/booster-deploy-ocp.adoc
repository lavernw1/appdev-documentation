= Deploying your Booster to {OpenShiftContainerPlatform}

IMPORTANT: In order to deploy a booster to {OpenShiftContainerPlatform}, you must first create it using the {launcher} application in link:{link-getting-started-guide}#oso-create-booster[{OpenShiftOnline}] or link:{link-getting-started-guide}#osl-create-booster[a {OpenShiftLocal}].

To use the `oc` CLI Client with {OpenShiftContainerPlatform}, follow the same steps as with your {OpenShiftLocal} but use the authentication token and URL from the {OpenShiftContainerPlatform} Web Console.

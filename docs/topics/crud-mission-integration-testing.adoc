= Running Integration Tests

This booster includes a self-contained set of integration tests.
When you run the tests inside an empty OpenShift project, they:

* deploy a test instance of the application to the project,
* execute the individual tests on that instance,
* remove the test instance of the application from the project when the testing is done.

Before running the tests, ensure that you:

* are logged into your OpenShift account,
* have selected a project within that account.

[WARNING]
--
Running the integration tests in an OpenShift project already containing an instance of the tested application removes the pre-existing instance of the application from the project when the testing finishes.
--

To run the integration tests, execute the following command:

[source,bash,option="nowrap"]
--
mvn clean verify -Popenshift,openshift-it
--

= Using {launcher} to Create a Runtime Project Framework Project

After you have the {launcher} application running on your {OpenShiftLocal}, you can use it to create a runtime project framework project.

To create a runtime project framework:

. Select _Begin by selecting a runtime project framework_ and click _Next_.
. Choose the project type you would like to run. You may update any of the pre-filled details or leave them with the default details. Click _Next_.
. Fill in the setup options and choose any dependencies you would like to have preconfigured. Click _Finish_

NOTE: You can come back to the {launcher} application later and try different options. 


You have just created your runtime project framework project and are now on the launch screen. Follow the steps in xref:launcher-launch-runtime-project-framework[] to deploy it.

= Prerequisite: Deploying the Booster and Determine Its Route

Before proceeding, follow the instructions in the `README.md` to deploy your booster and determine its URL.

.Example Deploying the Booster

Check the status of your booster and ensure your pod is running.

.Example to Check the Status the Booster Pod
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get pods -w
NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
app1                             1/1       Running     0          1m
app1-build                       0/1       Completed   0          1m
app2                             1/1       Running     0          1m
app2-build                       0/1       Completed   0          1m

Once your booster is deployed and started, you can check its route information for the URL to access it.

.Example to Check the Available Routes
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get routes
NAME                 HOST/PORT                                         PATH      SERVICES             PORT      TERMINATION
{app-name}           {app-name}-{project-name}.{osl-route-hostname}        {app-name}                     8080

= Project Structure
The project is split into two Apache Maven modules:

app:: 
The `app` module exposes the REST Service using {runtime-name}.

sso::
The `sso` module is a submodule link to the link:https://github.com/obsidian-toaster-quickstarts/redhat-sso[redhat-sso] project that contains the OpenShift objects required to deploy the {RHSSO} Server 7.1 as well as a Java command line client driver to test access to the secured endpoint.

= {RHSSO} Realm Model

The `master` realm is used to secure this booster. It is defined using the `src/main/resources/master.json` JSON description. There are four pre-configured application client definitions that provide a model for command line clients and the three secured REST endpoints. There are also two pre-configured users in the {RHSSO} `master` realm that can be used to validate various authentication and authorization outcomes:  `admin` and `alice`.

== {RHSSO} Users
The realm model for the secured boosters includes two users:

admin::
The `admin` user has a password of `admin` and is the realm administrator. This user has full access to the {RHSSO} administration console, but none of the role mappings that are required to access the secured endpoints. You can use this user to illustrate the behavior of an authenticated, but unauthorized user.

alice:: 
The `alice` user has a password of `password` and is the canonical application. This user will demonstrate successful authenticated and authorized access to the secured endpoints. A representation of the role mappings is provided in this decoded JWT bearer token

<1> The iss(user) field corresponds to the {RHSSO} realm instance URL that issues the token. This must be configured in the secured endpoint deployments in order for the token to be verified.
<2> The `roles` object provides the roles that have been granted to the user at the global realm level. In this case
`alice` has been granted the `vertx-admin` role. We will see that the {VertX} secured endpoint will look to the
realm level for authorized roles.
<3> The `resource_access` object contains resource specific role grants. Under this object you will find an object
for each of the secured endpoints.
<4> The `resource_access.secured-swarm-endpoint.roles` object contains the roles granted to `alice` for the `secured-swarm-endpoint` resource.
<5> The `resource_access.secured-vertx-endpoint.roles` object contains the roles granted to `alice` for the `secured-vertx-endpoint` resource.
<6> The `resource_access.secured-springboot-endpoint.roles` object contains the roles granted to `alice` for the `secured-springboot-endpoint` resource.
<7> The `preferred_username` field provides the username that was used to generate the access token.

== The Application Clients
The OAuth 2.0 specification allows you to define a role for application clients that access secured resources on behalf of resource owners. The `master` realm has four application clients defined:

demoapp::
This is a `confidential` type client with a client secret that is used to obtain an access token that contains grants for the `alice` user which enable `alice` to access the {WildFlySwarm}, {VertX} and {SpringBoot} based REST booster deployments.

secured-swarm-endpoint::
The `secured-swarm-endpoint` is a bearer-only type of client that requires a `swarm-admin` role for accessing the associated resources that represents the secured {WildFlySwarm} booster.

secured-vertx-endpoint::
The `secured-vertx-endpoint` is a bearer-only type of client that requires a `vertx-admin` role for accessing the associated resources that represents the secured {VertX} booster.

secured-springboot-endpoint::
The `secured-springboot-endpoint` is a bearer-only type of client that requires a `springboot-admin` role for accessing the associated resources that represents the secured {SpringBoot} booster.

== Security Constraints

The Secured booster establishes a security context that is managed by {RHSSO} using adaptor code that verifies a signed JSON web token, like the one shown for the `alice` user, using configuration information that allows the adaptor code to verify the token.

The configuration information includes things like the realm name, the realm public key, the {RHSSO} server auth URL, and resource target.

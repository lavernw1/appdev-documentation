= Releasing New Version

This section contains all information you need to release a new version of the documentation set to production. This update can happen anytime after the catalog has been updated, including after the release train has been completed.

== Procedure

.Releasing New Version to Production
. Ensure the catalog has been updated. Contact the development team for this information.
. Update the following lines with the latest version:
+
--
* link:{link-repo-docs}blob/master/scripts/deploy_launchpad_mission.sh#L16[Catalog Version in Build Script]
* link:{link-repo-docs}blob/master/docs/topics/minishift-install-create-launchpad-app-script.adoc#L33[Update Install Instructions when using the `-v` option]

Usually, update version `vX` to `vX+1`, for example `v3` to `v4`.
--

. Synchronize the {WildFlySwarm} sources. For more information, see xref:syncing-with-wildfly-swarm-docs[].

. Update the current milestone in GitHub:
.. Rename the _Current Development_ milestone to the current date in the _YYYY-MM-DD_ format.
.. Create a new milestone called _Current Development._
.. Move all open issues from the old milestone to _Current Development:_
... Open the recently closed milestone from the link:{link-repo-docs}milestones[list of milestones].
... Ensure you are only seeing open issues by clicking _Open._
... Select all issues.
... In the top right corner of the table, click _Milestone_ -> _Current Development_ to assign the selected issues to the current milestone.
.. Close the old milestone.

. Add the issues resolved in the last milestone to `CHANGELOG.adoc`:
.. Execute the `generate_changelog.sh` script from the `$REPO_HOME/scripts` directory with the name of the milestone.
+
--
WARNING: Ensure you use the human-readable name of the milestone, not the numerical ID.

For example, with the _2017-04-21_ milestone:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ ./scripts/generate_changelog.sh '2017-04-21'
----

[NOTE]
====
The script asks you for a GitHub token. If you do not have such a token, generate one at link:https://github.com/settings/tokens[your GitHub token page].
When creating the token, set the access permission for it to `public_repo`.

Alternatively, you can store the access token in the `.github_token` file in `$REPO_HOME`.
If you do that, ensure the access permissions on the `.github_token` file do not allow reading by other users.
====

The script outputs a list of issues in the AsciiDoc format to the standard output. If the output is empty, it is likely one of the following situations occurred:

* You have misspelled the name of the milestone.
* You have not specified an access token and GitHub started limiting queries from your IP address. In this case, execute the script again and input the access token when asked.
--
.. Copy the output of the `generate_changelog.sh` script to the `CHANGELOG.adoc` file and add a heading that points to the corresponding release.
+
--
For example, with the _2017-04-21_ release:

[source,asciidoc,options="nowrap"]
----
== link:{link-repo-docs}/releases/tag/2017-04-21[2017-04-21 Release]
----
--

. Tag the release:
.. Execute the `tag_release.sh` script in the `$REPO_HOME/scripts` directory:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ ./tag_release.sh
----

The script automatically tags the commit with the current date in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. If you are re-releasing the same day, a suffix `_2`, `_3`, etc. is appended. If you want to tag with a different date or manually, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ git tag 2017-04-21
----
--
.. Push the changes and tags:
+
--
[source,bash]
----
$ git push --follow-tags $REMOTE
----

Replace `$REMOTE` with the name of the upstream remote.
--

. Request publication:
.. File a pull request in the link:https://github.com/openshiftio/saas-launchpad/blob/master/launchpad-services/appdev-documentation.yaml#L2[openshiftio/saas-launchpad] repository, where you change the `hash` value to the hash of the commit you want to publish from the link:{link-repo-docs}[appdev-documentation] repository. Usually, this will be the latest commit in the `master` branch.
.. Wait for the pull request to be accepted. When that happens, verify that the link:{docs-stage}[stage build] succeeded.

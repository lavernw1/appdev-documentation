= Interacting with the Unmodified {NodeJS} Booster

The booster provides a default HTTP endpoint that accepts `GET` requests.

. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the booster. You can also use a browser to do this.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]

$ curl http://{app-name}-{project-name}.{osl-route-hostname}/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World from a ConfigMap !"}
----
. Update the deployed ConfigMap configuration.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc edit configmap app-config
----

Change the value for the `message` key to `Bonjour, %s from a ConfigMap !` and save the file.


. Update of the ConfigMap should be read by the application within an acceptable time (a few seconds) without requiring a restart of the application.
. Use `curl` to execute a `GET` request against the booster with the updated ConfigMap configuration. You can also use a browser to do this.
